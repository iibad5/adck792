    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Pong</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021). This project shows the various skills I have learned throughout the bootcamp and how I have used them to make this game. I have used various global variables, conditions and methods such as (keyPressed) to make my game work. My project is a simple game of pong, with two paddles and one ball which bounces off the paddles,top and bottom. The scores are displayed on top, and as the ball gets out of the play, the scores are changed and the ball is reset. At the end the player who reaches 3 points wins the game, and a "WIN" text is displayed on their side.
